# 📘 Week 1 - Introduction to MLOps

## 📌 1.1 MLOps Introduction

**MLOps** stands for **Machine Learning Operations** — a discipline focused on deploying, managing, and automating ML models in production environments.

### ✅ What is MLOps?

- A combination of **tools, practices, and processes** that help teams reliably and efficiently deploy and maintain machine learning models in production.
- It enables moving from experimentation to deployment **without losing reproducibility, reliability, and scalability**.

### 🚴 Use Case: Duration of Ride Prediction Problem

A common ML problem used to illustrate MLOps is predicting the **duration of a rider’s trip** based on data like pickup/dropoff time and location.

### ⚙️ Key Stages in ML Workflow

The typical lifecycle of a machine learning project can be broken down into three stages:

Design ---> Train ---> Operate


- **Design**: Understanding the business problem, data exploration, feature selection, model architecture design.
- **Train**: Training and evaluating models, tuning hyperparameters, validating performance.
- **Operate**: Deploying models to production, monitoring, retraining, and maintaining them.

---

### 🌐 Model Deployment

- ML models are usually deployed as **web services**, often via RESTful **APIs**, allowing other applications to interact with them in real time.

---

### 🛠️ Role of MLOps

MLOps supports every stage of the ML lifecycle by:

- **Improving collaboration** among team members.
- Ensuring **reproducibility** of experiments.
- Enabling **automated retraining** and **one-click deployments**.
- Facilitating **version control** for both code and data.
- **Monitoring** model performance and enabling CI/CD pipelines.

> 🔁 In short, MLOps brings DevOps-style automation and collaboration to machine learning projects.

### 🛠️ 1.2 - Environment Configuration/Setup

Set up the MLOps Zoomcamp development environment using **GitHub Codespaces**, **AWS EC2**, **Anaconda**, **Docker**, and **VS Code Remote SSH**.
